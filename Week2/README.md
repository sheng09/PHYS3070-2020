# 2. Code, Compile and Execute Programs
- [ ] Compile a `FORTRAN` program to generate the executable file, and run the executable file.
```bash
# Enter into the directory week2/
cd week2/
# Compile a example program of FORTRAN
gfortran exam1.f -o exam1
# Check the generated executable file
ls -ltr # Have you seen the file `exam1`, the newest file
# Run the executable file
./exam1
```
- [ ] Use `gedit` or `vim` or other editors to view a simple `FORTRAN` program.
